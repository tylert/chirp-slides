CHIRP Memory Programming
========================

Modern Transceivers
===================

.. class:: incremental

* DC-to-daylight mobile rigs and HTs
* 1000+ "channel" memories
* tiny screens, big manuals
* fancy-combo button presses
* cryptic symbols (e.g.: "R")


Usability
=========

G.I.G.O.
========

.. class:: incremental

* a few spare transceivers
* lend them out for events
* configure them all the same
* hundreds of button presses
* wrong tones, offsets?


Remote Assistance
=================

Software Solution
=================

.. class:: incremental

* sold as an accessory, for more $$$
* works on only 1 OS and/or version
* usually different for each rig
* uses custom data formats
* nearly impossible to diagnose errors


Helpful Messages
================

* "Windows Error 587" -> ERROR_MUTANT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

Enter CHIRP
===========

.. class:: incremental

* over 100 radios supported
* new ones added all the time
* costs nothing, royalty-free
* open, non-proprietary data formats
* will run on nearly every OS (Python + GTK)


OSes
====

.. class:: incremental

* Windows XP, 2000, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and so on
* Linux, Mac OS X, (Unix, BSD, Solaris, etc.)

Features Focus
==============

.. class:: incremental

* simple "no-frills" interface
* basic support for lots of radios
* get/set (some) rig settings
* allow import/export of memories
*


About CHIRP
===========

.. class:: incremental

* http://chirp.danplanet.com
* Dan Smith KK7DS + many others
* wiki with helpful documentation
* look at the code ("open source")
* GPLv3 license ("free software")


Error-free
==========

I would love to
change the world,
but they won't give me
the source code.

Memory Reminders
================

.. class:: incremental

* name (up to 6 or 7 characters)
* mode, output frequency + offset
* CTCSS/DCS tones
* channel scanning "skip"
* D-STAR stuff (DMR, P25, etc. too?)


What can you do with it?
========================

.. class:: incremental

* share plain text files (CSV)
* keep backup "image" files
* maintain event-specific lists
* store repeater groups for travel
* fetch info from online sources


Getting Started
===============

.. class:: incremental

* check if your rig is supported
* TTL-to-USB or serial cable
* whatever weird connector on the end
* build or buy one
* download and install CHIRP (LiveCD?)


Cables
======

.. class:: tiny

Binary Images
=============

.. class:: incremental

* each preamble differs slightly
* download from radio to get image file
* copy/insert memories into slots
* upload image back to radio
* save image and/or export to csv
